# Quora-Question-Similarity

Currently, Quora uses a Random Forest model to identify duplicate questions. In this project, natural language processing problem is solved by applying advanced techniques to classify whether question pairs are duplicates or not. Doing so will make it easier to find high quality answers to questions resulting in an improved experience for Quora writers, seekers, and readers.

we used sequence networks using tensorflow to solve this problem and also concatenation of sequence layers is done.
